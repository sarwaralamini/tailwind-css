    <!-- SONT SMOOTHING -->
    <h1 class="font-bold">Font Smoothing (antialiased)</h1>
    <p class="antialiased text-lg">
        This class applies grayscale anti-aliasing to make fonts look softer. It's ideal for regular-sized text to make it appear smoother on high-resolution displays.
    </p>

    <h1 class="font-bold mt-3">Font Smoothing (subpixel-antialiased)</h1>
    <p class="subpixel-antialiased text-lg">
        This class applies subpixel anti-aliasing, which often makes fonts appear sharper. Itâ€™s useful when you want the text to be more readable, especially for smaller fonts.
    </p>

    <!-- Explanation
    Grayscale anti-aliasing (antialiased) smooths text edges without using color, making it more suited for dark text on light backgrounds or vice versa.
    Subpixel anti-aliasing (subpixel-antialiased) leverages colored subpixels to improve the smoothness, often creating sharper-looking text at smaller sizes. -->
